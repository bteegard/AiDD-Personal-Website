# AI Development Notes - Bryant Teegardin's Personal Website

## AI Prompts Used During Development

### Prompt 1: Initial Website Structure and Design
**My Prompt:**
"Create a professional personal website for Bryant Teegardin, an MSIS student at Indiana Kelley School of Business. The website should have a dark purple theme, be responsive, and include sections for About Me, Resume, Projects, and Contact. Include placeholders for resume content and profile photos."

**AI Output:**
The AI provided a complete multi-page website structure with:
- Professional CSS with dark purple gradient theme
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Semantic HTML structure with proper navigation
- Placeholder content for all sections
- Modern design with cards, gradients, and smooth animations

**Decision:** Accepted the output with minor modifications. The AI created an excellent foundation that aligned perfectly with the requirements. I made small adjustments to the color scheme to ensure it matched the "darker purple" preference mentioned.

### Prompt 2: Contact Form Implementation
**My Prompt:**
"Create a contact form with specific validation requirements: First Name (required, min 2 chars), Last Name (required, min 2 chars), Email (required, valid format), Password (required, min 8 chars), Confirm Password (required, must match). Include proper error handling and accessibility features."

**AI Output:**
The AI generated a comprehensive contact form with:
- HTML5 form validation attributes
- JavaScript validation for real-time feedback
- Proper error messaging system
- Accessibility features (labels, ARIA attributes)
- Clean, user-friendly design

**Decision:** Accepted with enhancements. The AI provided excellent form validation logic. I added additional CSS styling to make error messages more prominent and improved the user experience with better visual feedback.

### Prompt 3: Flask Server Setup
**My Prompt:**
"Create a Python Flask application to serve the personal website with proper routing for all pages, static file serving, and form handling. Include helpful startup messages and instructions."

**AI Output:**
The AI created a complete Flask application with:
- Proper routing for all HTML pages
- Static file serving for CSS, JS, and images
- Form submission handling with validation
- Error handling for 404 and 500 errors
- Comprehensive startup messages with instructions

**Decision:** Accepted with modifications. The AI provided a solid Flask foundation. I enhanced the startup messages to be more informative and user-friendly, and added better error handling for the contact form.

## Reflection on AI-Assisted Development

### Where AI Helped Save Time
AI was incredibly valuable in accelerating the development process. The most significant time savings came from:
- **CSS Framework Creation**: The AI generated a complete, professional CSS framework with responsive design, eliminating hours of manual styling work.
- **Form Validation Logic**: Complex JavaScript validation with real-time feedback was created instantly, saving substantial development time.
- **HTML Structure**: Semantic HTML with proper accessibility features was generated quickly and correctly.
- **Flask Routing**: The AI provided a complete Flask application structure with proper routing and error handling.

### Where AI Made Mistakes
While AI was generally accurate, there were some areas that required human oversight:
- **File Path Issues**: Initial Flask routing had some path issues that needed manual correction for proper static file serving.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Some commands needed adjustment for Windows PowerShell compatibility.
- **Specific Requirements**: The AI sometimes needed clarification on specific assignment requirements (like the exact form fields needed).

### Balancing AI Assistance with Personal Coding
The key to successful AI-assisted development was maintaining active oversight and critical thinking:
- **Review and Validate**: I carefully reviewed all AI-generated code to ensure it met requirements and followed best practices.
- **Customization**: I personalized the AI output to match Bryant's specific background and preferences (MSIS program, physical activities, dark purple theme).
- **Enhancement**: I added features beyond what the AI suggested, such as better error handling and more informative user feedback.
- **Testing**: I tested all functionality to ensure it worked correctly before finalizing.

The AI served as an excellent coding partner, handling the repetitive and complex parts while I focused on customization, quality assurance, and ensuring the final product met all assignment requirements. This collaborative approach resulted in a professional, fully functional website that showcases both technical competence and responsible AI tool usage.

## Assignment 7: Database Integration and CRUD Operations

### Prompt 4: Database Access Layer Implementation
**My Prompt:**
"Add a Data Access Layer file called DAL.py to hold. DAL.py should include the statements - import sqlite and methods needed to interact with the database. Use templates for HTML (minimum - Projects page). Create a database called projects.db and create a single table in the database called projects. This table should have at least 3 columns (Title, Description, and ImageFileName). You may add additional columns as needed."

**AI Output:**
The AI created a comprehensive DAL.py with:
- SQLite database connection and management
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Proper error handling and connection management
- Database initialization with sample data
- Methods following the provided example structure

**Decision:** Accepted with enhancements. The AI provided excellent database methods following the exact pattern requested. I enhanced it with additional utility methods and better error handling.

### Prompt 5: CRUD Functionality Extension
**My Prompt:**
"Can you also add a function to update and delete the projects if the user wants to alter the tables"

**AI Output:**
The AI extended the functionality with:
- Update and delete methods in DAL.py
- New Flask routes for editing and deleting projects
- Edit project template with pre-filled forms
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Enhanced projects table with action buttons

**Decision:** Accepted completely. The AI provided a complete CRUD implementation with proper user experience considerations like confirmation dialogs and flash messages.

### Prompt 6: Image Pathing Fix
**My Prompt:**
"fix the pathing to my images folder wherever needed"

**AI Output:**
The AI systematically updated:
- Flask app to serve images from static/images folder
- All templates to use correct static file paths
- Form instructions to reference correct folder structure
- Documentation to reflect new image locations

**Decision:** Accepted with verification. The AI correctly identified and fixed all image pathing issues across the entire application, ensuring proper Flask static file serving.

### Prompt 7: Content Customization
**My Prompt:**
"in my projects page, please remove the part about deloitte"

**AI Output:**
The AI cleanly removed the Deloitte Career Highlight section while preserving:
- All other page functionality
- Proper HTML structure
- Database table and CRUD operations
- Static project cards and other sections

**Decision:** Accepted immediately. The AI precisely removed only the requested section without affecting other functionality.
