                    <h3>My Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Bryant Teegardin, a dedicated Master's student in Information Systems at the Indiana Kelley School of Business, 
                        and incoming Technology Enablement and Transformation Analyst at Deloitte Consulting in Chicago. 
                        My journey in technology and business is driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to excellence.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Currently pursuing my MSIS degree, I am deeply engaged in exploring how information systems can transform 
                        business operations and drive strategic decision-making. The Kelley School's rigorous curriculum and 
                        industry-focused approach have provided me with invaluable insights into the intersection of technology and business.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Academic Background</h3>
                    <p>
                        My academic journey at the Indiana Kelley School of Business has been exceptional. I'm currently pursuing 
                        my Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) with a 3.70 GPA, while also completing my Bachelor of Science 
                        in Business with majors in Information Systems, Operations Management, and Business Analytics (3.48 GPA). 
                        I've been honored to receive a Graduate Assistant position based on academic achievement and was awarded 
                        the prestigious Miami County Remit Scholarship ($34,000) for my academic excellence and community impact.

                        Beyond academics, I'm passionate about physical fitness and outdoor activities. These pursuits have taught me 
                        valuable lessons about discipline, perseverance, and goal-setting that I apply to my professional endeavors.
